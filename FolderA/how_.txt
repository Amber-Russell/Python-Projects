How a loop works:

For example, you could direct the computer to search through a list of paint colors until the color “red” is found. The list the computer will search is this:


Blue

Yellow

Red

Orange

White

Here is what it could look like in pseudocode:


Step 1: Get the next consecutive item in the list.


Step 2: Check whether the item equals “Red.”


Step 3: If the item equals “Red,” exit this loop.


Step 4: If the item is not equal to “Red,” loop back to step 1.


When this loop is executed, it will run like this:


Step 1: Acquired “Blue”


Step 2: Checked if item “Blue” is equal to “Red”


Step 3: Item not equal to “Red.” Did not exit the loop.


Step 4: Item not equal to “Red.” Looped back to Step 1.


Step 1: Acquired “Yellow”


Step 2: Checked if item “Yellow” is equal to “Red”


Step 3: Item not equal to “Red.” Did not exit the loop.


Step 4: Item not equal to “Red.” Looped back to Step 1.


Step 1: Acquired “Red”


Step 2: Checked if item “Red” is equal to “Red”


Step 3: Item equal to “Red.” Exited the loop.
